Hello,

I'm Sehar Fiaz, and I'm passionate about hybrid app development and web development using PHP, particularly with different PHP frameworks such as Doliabar and CodeIgniter. In my work, I utilize technologies like Ionic 5, Angular 11, and Node.js for hybrid app development.

Currently, I am actively expanding my skillset by learning Laravel and React Native, which are valuable additions to my development toolbox.

I'm always open to collaboration and exploring exciting projects. If you'd like to get in touch with me, please feel free to reach out via email at "seharfiaz001@gmail.com."

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!

Best regards,
Sehar Fiaz
